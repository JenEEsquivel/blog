<div class="entry-content"><p>This is my fourth week&rsquo;s blog entry.  At this point, I have started to dream about code sometimes.  I find myself solving JavaScript problems as they appear in my dreams.  I remember when I first learned Spanish, I knew I was fairly fluent when I started dreaming <em>in</em> Spanish.  However, if I start dreaming <em>in</em> command-line, CSS or JavaScript, I guess I will have to redefine (literally and figuratively) my understanding of reprograming my mind.</p>

<p>In this week&rsquo;s mock-Scrum workshop, I learned a ton.  My group developed a desktop application from concept to release.  Ours was a to do list for completing office tasks, with extra features and incentives.  The concept was for existing employees at a business to have incentives to do miscellaneous office tasks so that the owner of the business wouldn&rsquo;t need to hire another salaried employee as an office manager to do the tasks.  To distinguish our app from existing ones, we decided that tasks would have a point value assigned to them and that those points would be redeemed for some incentive (decided upon by the management/administration.)</p>

<p>Our team decided to allow the app administrator to create &lsquo;to do&rsquo; tasks and assign a point value to them.  Like a Trello board, the task cards get moved from a to do column to a &ldquo;done&rdquo; column as an employee chooses them and claims the points for completing each.  Tasks refresh at set intervals, if needed (daily tasks reset daily, e.g.)  The employee can then claim the points earned for rewards made available by the owner (examples might be a massage gift certificate, extra vacation time, or a flight to somewhere.)  We decided to integrate it with <strong>SLack</strong> so that employees could comment about the task, if needed.  I came up with the branding and logo concept. I thought &ldquo;DoPoint&rdquo; was a cute play on words.  The &ldquo;t&rdquo; in the word would be a themometer.  The themometer-like graphic repeats through the app to measure each employee&rsquo;s progress.  There were many other features and things we learned while doing the project.  We all played different roles (job titles) so that we could get a better understanding of how a real world team works on a project.  Overall, I learned a tremendous amount and had fun doing it.</p>

<p>We also started on basic design.  Although I have studied graphic design and fine arts, and am an artist, I learned several new things.  I refreshed my memory about color theory and other design concepts.  Overall, it was a great week.</p>
