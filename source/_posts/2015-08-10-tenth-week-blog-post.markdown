##Tenth Week Blog

Only one week left?  It's hard to believe.  Although it was sometimes very difficult, I have learned more than I ever expected from YWeb Academy.  Among many other things, this week we have been working on our group projects.  My group is creating an interactive website to help Spanish speakers learn HTML tags by providing English and Spanish translations as well as mnemonics, contextual and images to aid in memorization.  We intend for our app to allow users to contribute by adding additional definitions and information in the future.  This week on Thursday, I participated in the Ruby on Rails workshop and built a small app (on Heroku).  That night I went to Hype Harvest for YWeb Academy and finally I attended the Madison + Ruby Conference, which was great.
