This will be my final, wrap-up blog post for the YWebCA bootcamp.  What an amazing program!  I am very thankful to have been able to participate.  I learned more than I ever expected.  Although there were some struggles, overall this program is changing lives for the better.  This is due to the dedication of people behind the scenes at Adorable and the YWCA, the funders and the community of people who support us.  

I am not finished with this post.  I have lots more thanks to give here.
